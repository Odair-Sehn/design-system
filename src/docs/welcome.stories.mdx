# Getting Started

Welcome to the Dass Design System documentation. This guide will help you install and use the `ds-ui` lib package in your projects.

`ds-ui` is compatible with Vue v3.0 and above. Since the project isn't hosted in a package registry such as NPM yet, you will need to add it to your project through the private repo to start using it. This tutorial will help with all the steps.

## Installation

First, you need to set up your environment. [Follow these instructions](https://sga.grupodass.com.br/bitbucket/projects/DS/repos/ds-ui/browse/docs/INSTALL.md) to do so.

In your project, add the `ds-ui` to your dependencies like so:

```bash
# with yarn
yarn add git+ssh://git@10.100.0.22:7999/ds/ds-ui.git

# with NPM
npm install --save git+ssh://git@10.100.0.22:7999/ds/ds-ui.git
```

You can optionally choose which specific version of the `ds-ui` package you want to use by appending its version (eg. `#v1.0`) in the repository URL (check out the [CHANGELOG](https://sga.grupodass.com.br/bitbucket/projects/DS/repos/ds-ui/browse/docs/CHANGELOG.md)).

## Usage

You can add the `ds-ui` as a plugin in your app.

```js
// main.js, or your app entrypoint.
import { createApp } from "vue";
import dassDS from "ds-ui";
import App from "App.vue";

createApp(App).use(dassDS).mount("#app");
```

This will offer all components and required styling (with the default theme) to your application.

You can now use any component in the DS without needing to import each component:

```vue
<!-- App.vue -->
<template>
  <dass-button :variant="ds_variant"> My DS Button </dass-button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      ds_variant: "primary",
    };
  },
};
</script>
```
